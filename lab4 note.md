# JOS-operating-system

lab4

In this lab you will implement preemptive multitasking among multiple simultaneously active user-mode environments.

In part A you will add multiprocessor support to JOS, implement round-robin scheduling, and add basic environment management system calls (calls that create and destroy environments, and allocate/map memory).

In part B, you will implement a Unix-like fork(), which allows a user-mode environment to create copies of itself.

Finally, in part C you will add support for inter-process communication (IPC), allowing different user-mode environments to communicate and synchronize with each other explicitly. You will also add support for hardware clock interrupts and preemption.
